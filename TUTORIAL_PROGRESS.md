## Completed Phases

### Phase 0.1: Framework & Tooling Decision ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2025-10-31
**Commits:** 1 (a25f240)

**What was done:**
- Researched framework options (Astro, Next.js, SvelteKit, themes)

- Added GPG key to GitHub

**Key Decisions:**
- Framework: Astro 5.x (content-first, Islands Architecture)

- PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Deployment:** https://e8a65043.dstack-info.pages.dev

## Current Phase: 0.3 Component System Development

**Status:** Phase 0.3.0 complete, proceeding to Phase 0.3.1
**Started:** 2025-10-31 05:25 EDT

**Updated Plan for Phase 0.3:**
Per updated PROJECT_PLAN.md with testing strategy:

1. **Phase 0.3.0:** ✅ Vitest infrastructure setup → deploy → checkpoint → APPROVED
2. **Phase 0.3.1:** CodeBlock component with tests → deploy → checkpoint → approval
3. **Phase 0.3.2:** Step and progress components with tests → deploy → checkpoint → approval
4. **Phase 0.3.3:** Validation and output components with tests → deploy → checkpoint → approval
5. **Phase 0.3.4:** Navigation components with tests → deploy → checkpoint → approval
6. **Phase 0.3.5:** Component demo page and documentation → deploy → checkpoint → approval

**Components to Build:**
- CodeBlock.astro - Syntax highlighting + copy button
- StepCard.astro - Tutorial step display
- ProgressTracker.astro - Progress bar with localStorage
- ValidationIndicator.astro - Interactive checkboxes
- CommandOutput.astro - Terminal output display
- CollapsibleSection.astro - Expandable sections
- NavigationButtons.astro - Prev/Next navigation

**Requirements:**
- TypeScript props for type safety
- TailwindCSS with dstack design tokens
- Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Mobile responsive
- Dark mode compatible
- Interactive state management

**Current Step:** Phase 0.3.1 - Add tests to existing CodeBlock component and fix CSS bugs

**Note:** CodeBlock was built in commit d186ff9 before testing infrastructure existed. Phase 0.3.1 will add tests and fix CSS variable bugs.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong in First Attempt at Phase 0.3:
1. ❌ Made ONE large commit instead of 5 separate commits
2. ❌ Only deployed ONCE instead of after each commit
3. ❌ Only had ONE checkpoint instead of 5 checkpoints
4. ❌ Never created TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md (critical error)
5. ❌ Did not update progress document after confirmations

### Correct Methodology (Following PROJECT_PLAN.md):
1. ✅ Work on small, logical chunk
2. ✅ Commit (signed) after each chunk
3. ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages after each commit
4. ✅ Present checkpoint with testing plan
5. ✅ Wait for explicit approval
6. ✅ Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md with results
7. ✅ Proceed to next chunk

---

## Next Steps

1. Fix CodeBlock CSS variable bugs (use correct TailwindCSS variable names)
2. Write tests for CodeBlock component
3. Verify tests pass
4. Commit and deploy
5. Present checkpoint
6. Wait for approval
7. Update this document
8. Proceed to Phase 0.3.2 (StepCard and ProgressTracker)

---

## Important Reminders

- **NO SHORTCUTS** - Follow plan strictly
- **Commit early and often** - Small logical chunks
- **Deploy after EVERY commit** - Not just at the end
- **Checkpoint after EVERY commit** - Get approval before proceeding
- **Update this document** - After every approval
- **Small chunks** - Fit in one context window
- **All commits GPG signed** - No AI attribution

**End of Progress Document**

This document is updated after every checkpoint approval to preserve context during conversation compression.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0.1: Framework & Tooling Decision ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2025-10-31
**Commits:** 1 (a25f240)

**What was done:**

**Completed:** 2025-10-31 07:30 EDT
**Commits:** 6baadca, 9e09594, 38e9331

**What was done:**
- Fixed CSS variable bug (--text-primary → --color-text-primary)
- Created 9 comprehensive CodeBlock component tests
- Added TailwindCSS-only styling methodology (#10) to PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Fixed global.css universal reset that was breaking Tailwind utilities
- Converted CodeBlock to use ONLY TailwindCSS classes (removed all style blocks)
- Improved copy button to icon-only design with visual feedback
- Button shows checkmark on successful copy, X on error
- Removed focus outline for cleaner appearance

**Testing:**
- All 12 tests passing (9 CodeBlock + 3 sample)
- Component renders properly with padding
- Copy functionality works with icon feedback
- Title alignment matches code padding

**Key Learnings:**
- Universal `* { padding: 0; }` in global.css was overriding ALL Tailwind padding classes
- Must be careful with CSS resets when using utility-first frameworks
- TailwindCSS-only approach is more maintainable and consistent
- Icon-only buttons need good visual feedback (color + icon change)

**Files Changed:**
- PROJECT_PLAN.md (added methodology #10)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong in First Attempt at Phase 0.3:
1. ❌ Made ONE large commit instead of 5 separate commits
2. ❌ Only deployed ONCE instead of after each commit
3. ❌ Only had ONE checkpoint instead of 5 checkpoints
4. ❌ Never created TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md (critical error)
5. ❌ Did not update progress document after confirmations

### Correct Methodology (Following PROJECT_PLAN.md):
1. ✅ Work on small, logical chunk
2. ✅ Commit (signed) after each chunk
3. ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages after each commit
4. ✅ Present checkpoint with testing plan
5. ✅ Wait for explicit approval
6. ✅ Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md with results
7. ✅ Proceed to next chunk

### What We Learned in Phase 0.3.1:
1. ✅ Universal CSS resets (`* { padding: 0; }`) override ALL Tailwind utilities
2. ✅ Must use TailwindCSS-only styling for consistency and maintainability
3. ✅ No custom `<style>` blocks for layout/spacing/colors (methodology #10)
4. ✅ Icon-only buttons need strong visual feedback (color + icon change)
5. ✅ Test manually in browser - unit tests can't catch all visual/styling bugs
6. ✅ Iterate on styling before committing - save commit/deploy until approved

### What We Learned in Phase 0.3.2:
1. ❌ **CRITICAL ERROR:** Assumed git push would trigger automatic Cloudflare Pages deployment
2. ✅ **CORRECTION:** No webhooks configured - must MANUALLY deploy with `wrangler pages deploy dist`
3. ✅ Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md to document correct deployment process
4. ✅ Added reminder in "Never Forget" section to prevent future mistakes
5. ✅ Always build first (`npm run build`), then deploy (`wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=dstack-info`)
6. ✅ StepCard and ProgressTracker components work well with status-based styling
7. ✅ Dynamic color-coding provides clear visual feedback for progress states

## Current Phase: 0.4 Tutorial Platform Infrastructure

**Status:** Starting Phase 0.4.0
**Started:** 2025-10-31 08:50 EDT

**Phase 0.4 Plan:**
Breaking down into 5 sub-phases following successful Phase 0.3 methodology:

1. **Phase 0.4.0:** Layout system (BaseLayout, TutorialLayout, ComponentLayout) → commit → deploy → checkpoint
2. **Phase 0.4.1:** Content collections configuration (config.ts, content/tutorials/) → commit → deploy → checkpoint
3. **Phase 0.4.2:** Progress tracking system (utils/progress.ts with localStorage) → commit → deploy → checkpoint
4. **Phase 0.4.3:** Navigation and search (sidebar, breadcrumbs, basic search) → commit → deploy → checkpoint
5. **Phase 0.4.4:** Sample tutorial content and integration testing → commit → deploy → checkpoint

**Objectives:**
- Create reusable layout system for tutorials
- Configure Astro content collections for markdown tutorials
- Build progress persistence with localStorage
- Add sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs
- Implement basic search functionality
- Create sample tutorial to test entire system

**Requirements:**
- Use existing components from Phase 0.3
- TailwindCSS-only styling (methodology #10)
- TypeScript for all utility functions
- Mobile responsive layouts
- Progress tracking persists across page refreshes
- Accessible navigation (ARIA labels)

**Next Step:** Phase 0.4.0 - Layout system

---

## Important Reminders

- **NO SHORTCUTS** - Follow plan strictly
- **Commit early and often** - Small logical chunks
- **Deploy after EVERY commit** - Not just at the end
- **Checkpoint after EVERY commit** - Get approval before proceeding
- **Update this document** - After every approval
- **Small chunks** - Fit in one context window
- **All commits GPG signed** - No AI attribution

---

**End of Progress Document**

This document is updated after every checkpoint approval to preserve context during conversation compression.

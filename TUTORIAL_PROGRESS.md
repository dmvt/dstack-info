## Completed Phases

### Phase 0.1: Framework & Tooling Decision ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2025-10-31
**Commits:** 1 (a25f240)

**What was done:**
- Researched framework options (Astro, Next.js, SvelteKit, themes)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong in First Attempt at Phase 0.3:
1. ❌ Made ONE large commit instead of 5 separate commits
2. ❌ Only deployed ONCE instead of after each commit
3. ❌ Only had ONE checkpoint instead of 5 checkpoints
4. ❌ Never created TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md (critical error)
5. ❌ Did not update progress document after confirmations

### Correct Methodology (Following PROJECT_PLAN.md):
1. ✅ Work on small, logical chunk
2. ✅ Commit (signed) after each chunk
3. ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages after each commit
4. ✅ Present checkpoint with testing plan
5. ✅ Wait for explicit approval
6. ✅ Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md with results
7. ✅ Proceed to next chunk

### What We Learned in Phase 0.3.1:
1. ✅ Universal CSS resets (`* { padding: 0; }`) override ALL Tailwind utilities
2. ✅ Must use TailwindCSS-only styling for consistency and maintainability
3. ✅ No custom `<style />` blocks for layout/spacing/colors (methodology #10)
4. ✅ Icon-only buttons need strong visual feedback (color + icon change)
5. ✅ Test manually in browser - unit tests can't catch all visual/styling bugs
6. ✅ Iterate on styling before committing - save commit/deploy until approved

### What We Learned in Phase 0.3.2:
1. ❌ **CRITICAL ERROR:** Assumed git push would trigger automatic Cloudflare Pages deployment
2. ✅ **CORRECTION:** No webhooks configured - must MANUALLY deploy with `wrangler pages deploy dist`
3. ✅ Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md to document correct deployment process
4. ✅ Added reminder in "Never Forget" section to prevent future mistakes
5. ✅ Always build first (`npm run build`), then deploy (`wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=dstack-info`)
6. ✅ StepCard and ProgressTracker components work well with status-based styling
7. ✅ Dynamic color-coding provides clear visual feedback for progress states

- src/layouts/TutorialLayout.astro - Changed from prose to tutorial-content class
- src/__tests__/TutorialLayout.test.ts - Updated test for new class

**Key Learnings:**
- Content collections require server-side rendering, can't be tested with unit tests
- TailwindCSS @apply directive works well for scoped styling
- NavigationButtons component integrates cleanly with sorted tutorials
- Tutorials sorted by section then stepNumber for proper sequencing

## Current Phase: 0.4 Tutorial Platform Infrastructure

**Status:** Phase 0.4.4 IN PROGRESS - Sample tutorial content and integration testing
**Started Phase 0.4:** 2025-10-31 08:50 EDT
**Started Phase 0.4.4:** 2025-10-31 11:56 EDT

**Phase 0.4 Plan:**
Breaking down into 5 sub-phases following successful Phase 0.3 methodology:

1. **Phase 0.4.0:** ✅ Layout system (BaseLayout, TutorialLayout, ComponentLayout) → APPROVED
2. **Phase 0.4.1:** ✅ Content collections configuration (config.ts, content/tutorials/) → APPROVED
3. **Phase 0.4.2:** ✅ Progress tracking system (utils/progress.ts with localStorage) → APPROVED
4. **Phase 0.4.3:** ✅ Navigation and search (sidebar, breadcrumbs, basic search) → APPROVED
5. **Phase 0.4.4:** 🔄 Sample tutorial content and integration testing → IN PROGRESS

**Phase 0.4.4 Plan (Current - FINAL PHASE of 0.4):**
- Add 2-3 more sample tutorials to demonstrate the system
- Test multi-tutorial navigation and progress tracking
- Verify search works across multiple tutorials
- Verify sidebar groups tutorials correctly
- End-to-end testing of complete tutorial flow
- Final integration testing of all Phase 0.4 components
- Commit → build → deploy → checkpoint

**What I'm building:**
- Additional tutorial markdown files in different sections
- Integration test to verify all components work together
- Final polish and bug fixes

---

## Important Reminders

- **NO SHORTCUTS** - Follow plan strictly
- **Commit early and often** - Small logical chunks
- **Deploy after EVERY commit** - Not just at the end
- **Checkpoint after EVERY commit** - Get approval before proceeding
- **Update this document** - After every approval
- **Small chunks** - Fit in one context window
- **All commits GPG signed** - No AI attribution

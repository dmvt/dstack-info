## Completed Phases

### Phase 0.1: Framework & Tooling Decision ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2025-10-31
**Commits:** 1 (a25f240)

**What was done:**
- Researched framework options (Astro, Next.js, SvelteKit, themes)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong in First Attempt at Phase 0.3:
1. ❌ Made ONE large commit instead of 5 separate commits
2. ❌ Only deployed ONCE instead of after each commit
3. ❌ Only had ONE checkpoint instead of 5 checkpoints
4. ❌ Never created TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md (critical error)
5. ❌ Did not update progress document after confirmations

### Correct Methodology (Following PROJECT_PLAN.md):
1. ✅ Work on small, logical chunk
2. ✅ Commit (signed) after each chunk
3. ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages after each commit
4. ✅ Present checkpoint with testing plan
5. ✅ Wait for explicit approval
6. ✅ Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md with results
7. ✅ Proceed to next chunk

### What We Learned in Phase 0.3.1:
1. ✅ Universal CSS resets (`* { padding: 0; }`) override ALL Tailwind utilities
2. ✅ Must use TailwindCSS-only styling for consistency and maintainability
3. ✅ No custom `<style />` blocks for layout/spacing/colors (methodology #10)
4. ✅ Icon-only buttons need strong visual feedback (color + icon change)
5. ✅ Test manually in browser - unit tests can't catch all visual/styling bugs
6. ✅ Iterate on styling before committing - save commit/deploy until approved

### What We Learned in Phase 0.3.2:
1. ❌ **CRITICAL ERROR:** Assumed git push would trigger automatic Cloudflare Pages deployment
2. ✅ **CORRECTION:** No webhooks configured - must MANUALLY deploy with `wrangler pages deploy dist`
3. ✅ Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md to document correct deployment process
4. ✅ Added reminder in "Never Forget" section to prevent future mistakes
5. ✅ Always build first (`npm run build`), then deploy (`wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=dstack-info`)
6. ✅ StepCard and ProgressTracker components work well with status-based styling
7. ✅ Dynamic color-coding provides clear visual feedback for progress states

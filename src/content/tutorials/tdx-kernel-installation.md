# TDX Kernel Installation

This tutorial covers verifying the TDX kernel installation and rebooting your system to load the TDX-enabled kernel.

## Step 4: Verify Kernel Installation

Before rebooting, verify the TDX kernel was installed:

```bash
ls -la /boot/vmlinuz* | grep intel
```

**Expected output:**

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       24 Oct 31 18:38 /boot/vmlinuz -> vmlinuz-6.8.0-1028-intel
-rw------- 1 root root 15006088 May 23 15:48 /boot/vmlinuz-6.8.0-1028-intel
```

Check current kernel version:

```bash
uname -r
```

**Example output:**
```
6.8.0-57-generic
```

This shows you're still running the generic kernel. After reboot, you'll be running `6.8.0-1028-intel`.

## Step 5: Reboot to TDX Kernel

Reboot the server to load the TDX-enabled kernel:

```bash
reboot
```

**Note:** The server may take 2-3 minutes to reboot depending on hardware.

## Next Steps

Continue to **Part 4: TDX Status Verification** to verify the TDX kernel loaded successfully and check TDX status.

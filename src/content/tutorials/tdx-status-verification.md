# TDX Status Verification

This tutorial covers verifying that the TDX kernel loaded successfully and checking the TDX status to determine what BIOS configuration is needed.

## Step 6: Verify TDX Kernel Loaded

After reboot, SSH back into the server and verify the TDX kernel is running:

```bash
uname -r
```

**Expected output:**
```
6.8.0-1028-intel
```

âœ“ Success! You're now running the TDX-enabled Intel kernel.

## Step 7: Check TDX Status

Now let's check if TDX is enabled in the system.

### Check dmesg for TDX Messages

```bash
dmesg | grep -i tdx
```

**If TDX is enabled (after BIOS config), you should see:**
```
[    X.XXXXXX] virt/tdx: module initialized
```

**If TDX is NOT enabled (before BIOS config), output will be empty.**

### Check TDX Kernel Module

```bash
ls -la /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/ | grep tdx
```

**Expected output:**
```
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Oct 31 19:04 tdx
```

Check the TDX parameter value:

```bash
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/tdx
```

**Output:**
- `N` = TDX is NOT enabled (BIOS configuration needed)
- `Y` = TDX is enabled and ready to use

### Check TME (Total Memory Encryption)

TDX requires TME (Total Memory Encryption) to be enabled in BIOS:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i tme
```

**If TME is NOT enabled:**
```
[    0.000000] x86/tme: not enabled by BIOS
```

**If TME is enabled:**
```
[    0.000000] x86/tme: enabled by BIOS
```

### Check for SEAM Firmware

```bash
ls -la /sys/firmware/tdx* 2>/dev/null || echo "No TDX firmware found"
```

**If TDX is NOT enabled:**
```
No TDX firmware found
```

**If TDX is enabled, you'll see:**
```
/sys/firmware/tdx_seam/
```

# TDX Software Setup

This tutorial guides you through installing Canonical's TDX software stack, including the TDX-enabled kernel, QEMU, and libvirt components necessary for running Trust Domains.

## Step 1: Enable Root SSH Access

For this setup, you'll need root access. If you're using a non-root user with sudo privileges, you can enable root SSH access:

```bash
# As your regular user with sudo
sudo sed -i 's/^#*PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Restart SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

Copy your SSH keys to root:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
sudo cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
```

Test root SSH access:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP 'echo "Root access working"'
```

## Step 2: Clone Canonical TDX Repository

Canonical provides official scripts and tools for TDX setup in their GitHub repository.

```bash
cd /root
git clone -b main https://github.com/canonical/tdx.git
cd tdx
```

Verify the repository contents:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should see:

-   `setup-tdx-host.sh` - Main setup script for TDX host
-   `setup-tdx-guest.sh` - Script for TDX guest VMs
-   `setup-tdx-config` - Configuration file
-   `setup-tdx-common` - Common functions
-   `attestation/` - Attestation components (optional)
-   `guest-tools/` - Tools for guest VMs
-   `tests/` - Test scripts

## Step 3: Review TDX Configuration

Before running the setup, review the configuration file:

```bash
cat setup-tdx-config
```

**Important configuration options:**

```bash
# TDX PPA to use (default: tdx-release)
TDX_PPA="tdx-release"

# Attestation components (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)
TDX_SETUP_ATTESTATION=0

# NVIDIA H100 GPU support (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)
TDX_SETUP_NVIDIA_H100=0

# Intel-optimized kernel for guest VMs (0 = generic kernel, 1 = intel kernel)
TDX_SETUP_INTEL_KERNEL=0
```

### Enable TDX Attestation (Recommended)

**What is Attestation?**
Attestation provides cryptographic proof that:

-   Your workload is running in a genuine Intel TDX Trust Domain
-   The software stack (kernel, firmware, application) has not been tampered with
-   The hardware and configuration meet security requirements

**Why Enable Attestation?**

-   üîí **Essential for production** - Required for dstack and confidential computing deployments
-   ‚úÖ **Verifiable trust** - Cryptographically prove your workload is secure
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Industry standard** - Expected for enterprise confidential computing

**Enable attestation now:**
Edit the configuration file before running the setup:

```bash
nano setup-tdx-config
# Change: TDX_SETUP_ATTESTATION=0
# To:     TDX_SETUP_ATTESTATION=1
```

Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

**Note:** You can skip attestation setup if you only want to test basic TDX functionality. However, for dstack deployments, attestation is required to verify confidential computing guarantees.

## Next Steps

Continue to **Part 3: TDX Kernel Installation** to install the kernel, verify, and reboot into the TDX-enabled kernel.

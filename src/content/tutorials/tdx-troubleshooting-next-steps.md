# TDX Troubleshooting & Next Steps

This tutorial covers common TDX issues, their solutions, and guides you on what to do after successfully enabling TDX.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Before troubleshooting, verify your current TDX status:

```bash
# Check TDX parameter
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/tdx

# Check TME status
dmesg | grep -i tme

# Check TDX initialization
dmesg | grep -i tdx
```

### Issue: TDX Still Shows "N" After BIOS Config

**Possible causes:**
1. BIOS settings not saved properly
2. TME not enabled
3. Secure Boot interfering (try disabling)
4. SEAM loader not enabled

**Solution:**
- Re-enter BIOS and verify all settings
- Ensure TME and TME-MT are both enabled
- Check that SEAM Loader is enabled
- Try disabling Secure Boot temporarily

### Issue: "x86/tme: not enabled by BIOS"

**Cause:** TME not enabled in BIOS

**Solution:**
- Enter BIOS
- Navigate to CPU Configuration → Memory Encryption
- Enable TME and TME-MT
- Save and reboot

### Issue: TME-MT Option Greyed Out/Disabled

**Cause:** CPU Physical Address Limit is enabled (restricts to 46-bit addressing)

**Why this happens:** Intel MKTME (Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption), which TME-MT uses, requires upper address bits for encryption key IDs. The 46-bit physical address limit reserves these bits, preventing TME-MT from functioning. Many server BIOS configurations enable this by default for older OS/hypervisor compatibility.

**Solution:**
1. Enter BIOS
2. Navigate to: **Advanced → CPU Configuration** (or **Processor Configuration**)
3. Find: **"Limit CPU Physical Address to 46 bits"** or **"Physical Address Limit"**
   - May also be labeled: "Hyper-V Physical Address Limit" or "Address Width Limit"
4. **Disable** this setting
5. Save and reboot
6. Re-enter BIOS - TME-MT should now be selectable
7. Enable TME-MT and continue with TDX setup

**Note:** This is documented in Dell, ASUS, and other server vendor documentation. Enabling the 46-bit limit automatically disables TME-MT capabilities.

### Issue: No SEAM Firmware After Enabling TDX

**What this actually means:**

If you see your TDX status checks and do NOT see `virt/tdx: module initialized` in dmesg, or you see TDX-related errors during boot, this indicates the SEAM (Secure Arbitration Mode) firmware module failed to load.

**Important:** There is no `/sys/firmware/tdx*` directory to check. The absence of that path is normal and expected on all TDX systems. SEAM firmware is verified only through dmesg messages showing `virt/tdx: TDX module: ... module initialized`.

**Symptoms:**
- `dmesg | grep -i tdx` shows errors or no "module initialized" message
- `cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/tdx` returns `N` after enabling TDX in BIOS
- TDX-related error messages in dmesg

**Possible causes:**
1. Server firmware/BIOS needs update
2. Intel TDX SEAM module not installed in firmware
3. BIOS TDX settings not properly saved

**Solution:**
- Update server BIOS/firmware to latest version
- Check with server vendor for TDX support
- Verify BIOS settings were saved and applied (re-enter BIOS to confirm)
- Some early TDX-capable CPUs may need firmware updates

### Issue: Kernel Panic After Enabling TDX

**Cause:** Incompatible BIOS settings or outdated firmware

**Solution:**
- Boot into previous kernel from GRUB menu
- Update server BIOS/firmware
- Check Intel and server vendor documentation for specific TDX requirements

## What's Next?

Now that TDX is enabled on your host, you can:

### 1. Create TDX Guest VMs

- Use QEMU/libvirt to launch Trust Domains
- Configure TD guest images with TDX support

### 2. Test TDX Functionality

- Run Canonical's test suite: `cd tests && ./test-tdx.sh`
- Verify TD attestation

### 3. Enable TD Attestation (If Not Already Enabled)

- If you skipped attestation during initial setup, re-run with `TDX_SETUP_ATTESTATION=1`
- Attestation is **required for dstack production deployments**
- Provides cryptographic proof of confidential computing guarantees

### 4. Test TDX Attestation

- Verify attestation quote generation
- Test remote attestation flow
- Validate DCAP configuration

### 5. Deploy dstack

- Install dstack SDK
- Deploy confidential applications to TDX VMs
- Use attestation API for runtime verification

## Setup Complete Summary

You have successfully:

✓ Installed TDX-enabled kernel (6.8.0-1028-intel)
✓ Installed TDX-enabled QEMU, libvirt, and OVMF
✓ Configured GRUB for TDX kernel boot
✓ Enabled TDX hardware features in BIOS
✓ Verified TDX initialization

Your server is now ready to run Intel TDX Trust Domains!

- **Interactive platform**: Web-based with validation widgets and progress tracking
- **Production-ready**: Built to Linux Foundation standards for maintainability
- **Exhaustive documentation**: Every decision, error, and solution documented

### Project Scope
- 20+ comprehensive tutorial sections
- Complete Ansible automation (roles + playbooks)
- Interactive web platform (Astro + TailwindCSS)
- UI deployment dashboard
- 30+ git commits (all signed, deployed to Cloudflare Pages)
- 30+ review checkpoints with testing plans

---

## Core Principles & Methodology

### Absolute Requirements

#### 1. **NO SHORTCUTS**
- If TDX hardware not available: STOP and ask for help
- If configuration doesn't work: Debug and document, never simulate
- If service fails: Fix it properly, never skip
- Users must get real, working deployments from these tutorials

#### 2. **Dual Approach - Manual + Ansible**
- Every step must work via SSH (manual commands)
- Every step must work via Ansible (automation)
- Ansible playbooks built DURING tutorial writing, not after
- By end of each tutorial section, both approaches are complete and tested

#### 3. **Multi-User Verification**
- Create multiple test users on server (user1, user2, user3, etc.)
- Each checkpoint: Different users test manual and Ansible approaches
- Verify identical results between manual and automated deployment
- Document any discrepancies immediately

#### 4. **Git Best Practices**
- Commit early and often (after each logical step)
- All commits MUST be GPG signed
- NO AI attribution in commits (no "Co-Authored-By: Claude")
- Commit messages focus on what changed and why
- Every commit deployed to Cloudflare Pages for review

#### 5. **Checkpoint-Driven Development**
- After EVERY commit: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- Present complete testing plan for review
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
- Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md after each confirmation to preserve context

#### 6. **Small, Manageable Chunks**
- Work sized to fit in single context window
- Never try to do too much at once
- Break large tasks into smaller sub-tasks
- Each chunk must be completable and testable

#### 7. **Documentation First**
- Document what we're doing WHILE doing it
- Capture errors and solutions immediately
- Add troubleshooting sections based on real issues encountered
- Memory document (TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md) updated after every approval

#### 8. **Linux Foundation Standards**
- Production-quality code
- Clear, maintainable architecture
- Comprehensive documentation
- Built for future contributors
- Professional design and UX

#### 9. **Plan Adherence & Verification**
- Before starting any work: Verify it matches the current phase in PROJECT_PLAN.md
- If user requests work outside the plan or methodology: STOP and inform them
- Clearly state what conflicts with the plan/methodology
- Ask for explicit double confirmation before proceeding with out-of-plan work
- Never silently deviate from the documented plan
- If uncertain whether request aligns with plan: Ask for clarification

#### 10. **TailwindCSS-Only Styling**
- ALL styling must use TailwindCSS utility classes in the HTML/JSX
- NEVER use custom `<style>` blocks or inline styles for layout, spacing, colors, typography
- Only exception: Truly unique CSS that TailwindCSS cannot handle (rare)
- Custom fonts should be defined in global.css @theme, then used via Tailwind utilities
- Component-specific styles defeat the purpose of using a utility-first framework
- Easier to maintain, more consistent, better for future contributors

### Working Methodology

**For Each Tutorial Section:**

1. **Plan** - Define what we're installing/configuring
2. **Execute Manually** - Claude: SSH to server, run commands, document results
3. **Build Ansible** - Claude: Create role/playbook for same task
4. **Test Both Approaches** - Claude: Verify both manual and Ansible work correctly
5. **Verify Equivalence** - Claude: Confirm both approaches yield identical results
6. **Document Tutorial** - Claude: Write complete tutorial section with:
   - Prerequisites
   - Manual step-by-step instructions (tested and verified)
   - Ansible automation instructions (tested and verified)
   - Verification steps
   - Troubleshooting section (from real issues encountered)
7. **Create Validation Widget** - Claude: Build interactive validation component
8. **Git Commit** - Claude: Commit tutorial + Ansible + widget (signed)
9. **Deploy** - Claude: Push to Cloudflare Pages
10. **Checkpoint** - Claude: Present testing plan for user to dogfood the tutorial
11. **User Testing** - User: Follow tutorial as written, verify everything works
12. **User Approval** - User: Confirm tutorial works or request fixes
13. **Update Memory** - Claude: Add progress to TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md after approval
14. **Proceed** - Move to next section

**Key Principle: Dogfooding**
- Claude does all the work first and verifies it works
- Tutorial is written based on what actually worked
- User tests by following the tutorial as a new user would
- This ensures tutorials are accurate and complete

## Technology Decisions

### Framework: Astro + TailwindCSS (From Scratch)

**Decision Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** Proposed (awaiting approval)

#### Why Astro?
- Content-first framework, perfect for tutorial-heavy site
- Islands Architecture: Zero JavaScript by default, hydrate only interactive components
- Framework-agnostic: Can use Svelte/React/Vue for specific components
- Excellent performance and SEO
- First-class Cloudflare Pages support
- Great developer experience for contributors

#### Why TailwindCSS?
- Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- Design system via configuration (colors, spacing, typography)
- Widely known and documented
- Easy maintenance and modification
- No CSS bloat, only used classes included

#### Why From Scratch (Not Using Astro Theme)?
- Astro Starlight optimized for API/reference docs, not interactive tutorials
- Third-party themes built for generic use cases (blogs, portfolios)
- Our requirements too specialized:
  - Manual + Ansible parallel documentation
  - Interactive validation widgets
  - Progress tracking across 20+ tutorials
  - Deployment dashboard
  - Multi-user testing workflow
- Clean codebase better for Linux Foundation maintainability
- Full control over every component
- No fighting against theme opinions
- No unused features/bloat

#### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Framework | Astro 5.x | Static site generation + Islands |
| Styling | TailwindCSS 4.x | Utility-first CSS |
| Interactive Components | Svelte | Validation widgets, dashboards |
| Content | Markdown/MDX | Tutorial writing |
| Type Safety | TypeScript | Development quality |
| Unit Testing | Vitest | Component/unit testing |
| E2E Testing | Playwright | Browser automation testing |
| Test Environment | happy-dom | Lightweight DOM for unit tests |
| Package Manager | npm | Dependency management |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast builds and HMR |
| Deployment | Cloudflare Pages | Edge hosting |
| Version Control | Git | Signed commits |

**Testing Philosophy:**
- **Testing Pyramid:** Many unit tests (Vitest)  → Fewer E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Vitest:** Fast unit tests for component rendering, props, logic
- **Playwright:** Browser tests for user interactions, copy buttons, navigation
- **Coverage Target:** >80% unit test coverage, critical paths covered by E2E

**See ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md for complete rationale**

## Important Reminders

### Never Forget
1. **VERIFY PLAN ALIGNMENT** - Before starting work, confirm it matches PROJECT_PLAN.md
2. **FLAG OUT-OF-PLAN REQUESTS** - If user asks for something outside plan/methodology, inform them and get double confirmation
3. **NO SHORTCUTS** - Real deployments only
4. **Commit early and often** - After each logical step
5. **All commits signed** - No AI attribution
6. **Deploy after every commit** - To Cloudflare Pages
7. **Checkpoint after every commit** - With testing plan
8. **Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md** - After each approval
9. **Dual approach always** - Manual + Ansible (Phase 1+)
10. **Multi-user testing** - Different users for each approach (Phase 1+)
11. **Small chunks** - Fit in one context window
12. **Document everything** - Especially errors and solutions

### If Something Goes Wrong
- Document the issue immediately
- Add to troubleshooting section
- Ask for help if stuck
- Never simulate or skip
- Fix properly before proceeding

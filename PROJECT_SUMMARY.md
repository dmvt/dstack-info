## Next Steps for Deployment

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/lsdan/dstack/dstack-info
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: dstack.info website"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/dstack-info.git
git push -u origin main

# Then enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
```

### Option 2: Quick Preview Locally
```bash
# Open in browser
open index.html

# Or serve with Python
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000
```

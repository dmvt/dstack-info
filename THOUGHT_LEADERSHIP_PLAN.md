# Thought Leadership & Content Strategy for dstack

**Goal:** Establish dstack as the leading TEE SDK and build thought leadership in the confidential computing space, particularly within the Flashbots ecosystem.

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Messages
1. **Developer-First TEE Adoption**: TEE shouldn't require specialized knowledge or new tooling
2. **Open-Source Credibility**: Linux Foundation governance ensures vendor independence
3. **Production-Ready**: Real applications (AI agents, L2s, privacy protocols) running today
4. **Future of Computing**: Confidential computing is becoming table-stakes for privacy-sensitive apps

### Differentiation from Competitors
- **vs. Cloud TEE Services (AWS Nitro, Azure Confidential)**: Open-source, no vendor lock-in, decentralized trust
- **vs. Gramine/Occlum**: Docker-native, easier onboarding, managed service option (Phala Cloud)
- **vs. Building from Scratch**: Weeks to minutes deployment time, battle-tested infrastructure

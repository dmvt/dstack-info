## Key Findings

### Strengths of Existing Documentation

1. **Comprehensive API Coverage**
   - REST API fully documented
   - 6 RPC interfaces specified
   - Legacy API maintained for backwards compatibility

2. **Multi-Language SDK Support**
   - Rust SDK with sync and async clients
   - Python SDK with synchronous and asynchronous options
   - Go SDK with multiple client options
   - JavaScript/TypeScript SDK with browser support

3. **Security-First Approach**
   - Professional security audit included
   - Attestation and verification guides
   - Security best practices documented
   - Design hardening decisions explained
   - CVM security boundaries defined

4. **Complete Deployment Guides**
   - Full system deployment instructions
   - Gateway production setup
   - Configuration file specifications
   - Step-by-step examples

5. **Professional Presentation**
   - Clean, well-organized markdown
   - Architecture diagrams with good visual design
   - Professional logo kit with multiple variants
   - Consistent formatting and structure

### Documentation Gaps

1. **Limited Tutorials**
   - Few step-by-step end-to-end examples
   - Could benefit from "build your first app" guides

2. **Interactive Examples**
   - Examples are text-based in SDK docs
   - Could use interactive code playgrounds

3. **Video Content**
   - No video tutorials or walkthroughs
   - Could benefit from architecture explainer videos

4. **Community Examples**
   - Few real-world use case examples
   - Could showcase community projects

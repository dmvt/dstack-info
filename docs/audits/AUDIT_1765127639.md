## Recommendations

### Priority: LOW

1. **Update TUTORIAL_PROGRESS.md Header Date**
   - Current: "Last Updated: 2025-11-19"
   - Should reflect latest updates (2025-12-02)
   - Location: Line 3

2. **Consider Adding Skip-to-Content Link**
   - Accessibility test notes this as a consideration
   - Would improve keyboard navigation
   - Not blocking, but good for WCAG compliance

### No Action Required

- Build: Healthy
- Tests: All passing
- Documentation: Comprehensive
- Ansible: Complete for all implemented phases
- Tutorial structure: Valid and consistent

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Unit Tests
npm test

# E2E Tests (requires Playwright)
npm run e2e

# Ansible Lint (on server)
cd ansible && ansible-lint playbooks/*.yml
```

---

## Audit Conclusion

**Rating: EXCELLENT**

The dstack-info project is in excellent health. All builds pass, all 358 tests pass, documentation is comprehensive, and the dual-approach methodology (Manual + Ansible) is consistently applied across all implemented phases.

The project is ready to proceed with Phase 6 (Example Deployments) or continue with Phase 5 real hardware testing as planned.
